# Twitter-Img-Bot
A twitter bot that replies with an img resulted from a search with a tweet text.

This is a twitter bot made using the twit package - https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit - and the google API.
It will favourite, retweet and reply anybody who mention @RandyGoogleImg on a tweet, or reply a tweet if it's mentioned in the comments, with an image searched in google
with the tweet text (the text can be in Portuguese or English). Also, it will keep following random people with Brazil and EUA accounts for a while,
then will unfollow who doesn't followed it back for a while, and repeat.

The way the bot is selecting the image to reply need some improvement to get more relevant images.

It isn't running at this time because it was draining out my Heroku free dynos :)
